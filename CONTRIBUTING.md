## Data Science Package Code Contribution Guidelines
In order to make sure that our codebase is clean and stable we need to follow certain rules when we collaborate on extending packages.

1. Never commit directly on `Master` !!
2. Always make `Master` a protected branch, follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-protected-branches). If unsure, compare with the branch rules defined in the template repo, [here](https://github.com/Financial-Times/ds-package-template/settings/branches).
3. Attach a Trello card to any new branch, using the Git power-up in [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/1065-using-the-github-power-up)
4. A review is always required to merge back on `Master` (this is enforced but still good to have it mentioned here as well! )
5. Update tests as required per package
6. Don't forget to include meaningful comments in your code!
